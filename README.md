# 🍝 spaghetti.click

A chaotic clicker web toy inspired by **Hotel Mario's** infamous meme line...

> "Nice of the princess to invite us over for a *spaghetti*! 🍝"

## 📦 What is this?

**spaghetti.click** is a silly interactive site where every click spawns flying spaghetti emojis 🍝 and plays the iconic **"spaghetti!"** voice line — yes, *that* one.

It’s a loving homage to the golden era of YouTube Poops (YTP), especially **Hotel Mario** on the Philips CD-i — the source of some of the internet's most quotable nonsense.

This site was also **heavily inspired by** [lizard.click](https://lizard.click), which similarly features a one-button experience with chaotic visuals and sounds.

## 🧠 Meme Lore

The *"spaghetti"* line comes from the awkward and now-legendary cutscenes in **Hotel Mario**, a 1994 CD-i game developed by Fantasy Factory. It’s often cited in YouTube Poops and remix culture for its bizarre animation and voice acting.

YTP creators would remix this line, often stretching, distorting, and looping it for maximum absurdity.

## 💻 How does it work?

- Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + React
- Local click counter stored in `localStorage`
- Global counter synced via [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/)
- Emojis fly upward on each click
- Sound effect from Hotel Mario (fair use parody context)
